# Charter Competition and Traditional Public School Districts’ Resource Allocation: Evidence from Michigan Charter School Cap-lifting

Abstract: This paper studies the effect of policy-driven charter school competition on Traditional Public School Districts’ cost efficiency. The Michigan 2011 Cap-lifting policy introduces potential and actual competition of university-authorized charter schools across districts. By exploiting this arguably exogenous variation, I implement a Dynamic Difference-in-Differences research design to examine their response to both types of competition. Results suggest that districts prioritize on instructional employees and decrease their spendings on non-instructional employees. Little evidence indicates such change is driven by student sorting. The estimates provide evidence of effect of potential competition via districts' intention to deter future charter competition.
