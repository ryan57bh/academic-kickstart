# The long-Term Effect of Family Size on American Parents' Financial and Health Outcomes
​
Abstract: ​This paper studies the long-term effect of fertility choice on American parents' health outcomes using the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) longitudinal data between 1992 and 2014. Instrumenting the number of children using the gender composition and an proxy of having twins among the first two born, I find that additional children do not affect parents' probability of having chronic health conditions. Results suggest family size leads to an adverse effect on parents' risky health behaviors such as smoking and drinking but has little impact on adult children providing long-term care for parents. Although no long-term effect is found on retirement decision, additional evidence suggests that an increase in the number of children decreases parents' household assets and individual retirement account by more than 10%. This study sheds light on the growing needs of welfare programs for the American aging population.
